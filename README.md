# Unity ML-Agents + Streamlit

[Unity ML Agents Github](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)

## Notes

- I always struggle with creating nice charts! Need to get more fluent at `pd.DataFrame`.
- Not auto-rerunning when I change non-main modules. (Modifing `mlas` modules doesn't cause a rerun.)
- Want to have just a single instance running. (I really want `@st.singleton`!)
